module DataFrameAggrSpec

# A standalone, UI-free runtime DSL for DataFrame aggregation and dimensioning,
# extracted from TermWin. Everything is compiled at *runtime* (so specs can
# arrive as strings from a GUI, config file, or database — where DataFramesMeta's
# compile-time macros cannot reach).
#
#   * aggregation specs — `liftAggrSpecToFunc(:col, spec)` where `spec` is a
#     Symbol (`:sum`), an Expr (`:( mean(:_, :wcol) )`, with `:_` the on-the-fly
#     target column and `:col` a named column reference), or a `df -> ...`
#     lambda. `AggrHints` resolves per-column specs (col > eltype > default);
#     `aggregate(df, keys; hints)` is the grouped reduction.
#   * dimensioning — NEW columns computed from sibling rows sharing partition
#     keys, declared ONLY in chains: `name => spec` entries partitioned by
#     their left context, options via `dimspec(spec; by, order, kind)`. Two
#     kinds behind kind inference: window (row-level within a partition;
#     supports `order`) and pivot (classify groups by their aggregates) —
#     the types WindowDim/PivotDim are internals. Applied via `dim`/`dim!`;
#     `pivottable(df, chain; hints)` = dims + groupby + aggregate in one call.
#     Curried `dim(...)`/`pivottable(...)` return callable transforms
#     composable with `|>` and `∘`.
#   * presentation verbs — `discretize` (labeled/ranked binning), `topnames`
#     (top-N ranking with tie/dense/"Others" handling), `lag`/`lead`.
#   * legacy (deprecated, TermWin transition) — `CalcPivot` +
#     `liftCalcPivotToFunc`, shimmed over the dimension engine.
#
# SECURITY / TRUST BOUNDARY — the rule: Expr/Symbol/Function specs are TRUSTED;
# plain Strings are UNTRUSTED and parsed by the safe whitelist grammar (safe.jl —
# an eval-free, default-deny interpreter over the SafeOps registry) everywhere in
# the API. Sole exception: the frozen legacy `CalcPivot(::String)` constructor.
# Trusted Expr specs are compiled with `Core.eval(Main, ...)` so module-qualified
# names (e.g. `StatsBase.mean`) resolve against the *user's* loaded packages; the
# guards (must be a `:call`, no curly, simple/dotted name, reject any `!`) keep
# trusted-author specs honest but are NOT a sandbox — the String path is.
